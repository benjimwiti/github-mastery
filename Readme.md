#3rd change
GIT-HUB TO LOCAL SERVER
Cloning the git-mastery repository onto gitDemo folder.
had to create an SSH (secure Socket Shell) to use ssh key clone method.
ssh key has two types: a private key-identifies your computer as the sole owner of the github account, thus maybe gives user priviledges
                     : a public key{sth.pub}- loaded onto the github platform, it is seen publicly, function??
to create ssh key follow demo on git docs.
very helpful lady: https://youtu.be/RGOj5yH7evk 
it works and the clone is created.
she however loads the public key into github-main settings.
she also uses the ssh-rsa encryption strength; very dense key.
less dense using git docs

Functions learnt so far:
    git clone (ssh link from github);
    git status-to check on repo files status: untracked/tracked by the repo 
    git add index.html/. - tracks and or stages the tracked files
    git commit -m "title message" -m"description message"
    git push origin main.
